Encrypting Snaps has changed since the olden days of Snapchat 4.x. The secret key has changed, and the encryption method has also changed.

The secret key is `E8AB5F016F692E31631610147C368D19` and uses AES with an IV, which is 22 characters of base64, plus 2 `=` at the end for padding. Ex: `+4gqPv5/sYpljHojx0bUBA==`
